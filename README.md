# Incana!

So my dev portfolio website uses a simple full-stack approach:
Vite with Tailwind for the front-end setup and styling
ASP.NET for the APIs (stored in a different repository)
and Postgresql for the back-end.

I've only recently started working on it so it's fairly barebones, but I'm going to be adding little projects to it here and there. These will show up either as just a simple file in this repository (for single page apps contained entirely in HTML) or as a repo of their own for compiled apps.

## About

I'm still learning front-end development. Most of my dev history has been in back-end Javascript with ServiceNow, and with C# or Python for functional programming, but this is its own kind of fun. I'm enjoying it so far.
